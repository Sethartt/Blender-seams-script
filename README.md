# Blender-seams-script
Simple script for faster making seams on clothes (Blender).

How to use:
 - Select loop or few connected vertex and run script.

Problems:
 - If object is too small script will do mess with that object. You can fix this changing offset in first line of script.
 - It works only with closed loop or connected vertex/edges because array modifier can't handle them.
